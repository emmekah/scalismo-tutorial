# From meshes to deformation fields

*In this tutorial, we show how the deformation fields that relate two meshes can be computed and visualized.*

##### Preparation

As in the previous tutorials, we start by importing some commonly used objects and initializing the system. 

```scala mdoc:silent
import scalismo.geometry._
import scalismo.common._
import scalismo.ui.api._
import scalismo.registration.Transformation

scalismo.initialize()
implicit val rng = scalismo.utils.Random(42)

val ui = ScalismoUI()
```

We will also load three meshes and visualize them in Scalismo-ui.
```scala mdoc:silent
import scalismo.io.MeshIO

val dsGroup = ui.createGroup("datasets")

val meshFiles = new java.io.File("datasets/testFaces/").listFiles.take(3)
val (meshes, meshViews) = meshFiles.map(meshFile => {
  val mesh = MeshIO.readMesh(meshFile).get 
  val meshView = ui.show(dsGroup, mesh, "mesh")
  (mesh, meshView) // return a tuple of the mesh and the associated view
}) .unzip // take the tuples apart, to get a sequence of meshes and one of meshViews 

```

### Representing meshes as deformations

In the following we show how we can represent a mesh as a reference mesh plus a deformation field. This is possible 
because the meshes are all in correspondence; I.e. they all have the same number of points and points with the same id in the meshes represent
the same point/region in the mesh.

Let's say *face_0*, is the reference mesh:

```scala mdoc:silent
val reference = meshes(0) // face_0 is our reference
```
Now any mesh, which is in correspondence with this reference, can be represented as a deformation field.
The deformation field is defined on this reference mesh; I.e. the points of 
the reference mesh are the domain on which the deformation field is defined.  

The deformations can be computed by taking the difference between the corresponding
point of the mesh and the reference:
```scala mdoc:silent
val deformations : IndexedSeq[EuclideanVector[_3D]] = reference.pointSet.pointIds.map {
  id =>  meshes(1).pointSet.point(id) - reference.pointSet.point(id)
}.toIndexedSeq
```

From these deformations, we can then create a ```DiscreteVectorField```: 

```scala mdoc:silent
val deformationField = DiscreteField[_3D, UnstructuredPointsDomain[_3D], EuclideanVector[_3D]](reference.pointSet, deformations)
```

Similar to discrete scalar images, a Discrete Vector Field is defined 
over a discrete domain. In contrast to images, the domain does not need to be 
structured (a grid for example) and can be any arbitrary finite set of points. In the above example code, we defined the domain to be the reference mesh points, which 
is of type ```UnstructuredPointsDomain[_3D]```, as we can easily check:

```scala mdoc
val refDomain : UnstructuredPointsDomain[_3D] = reference.pointSet
deformationField.domain == refDomain
```

As for images, the deformation vector associated with a particular point id in a *DiscreteVectorField* can be retrieved via its point id:

```scala mdoc
deformationField(PointId(0))
```

We can visualize this deformation field in Scalismo-ui using the usual ```show```
command:

```scala mdoc:silent
val deformationFieldView = ui.show(dsGroup, deformationField, "deformations")
```
We can see that the deformation vectors indeed point from the reference to *face_1*.
To see the effect better we need to remove *face2* from the ui, 
make the reference transparent

```scala mdoc:silent
meshViews(2).remove()
meshViews(0).opacity = 0.3
```

*Exercise: generate the rest of the deformation fields that represent the rest of the faces in the dataset and display them.*


### Deformation fields over continuous domains:

The deformation field that we computed above is discrete as it is 
defined only over the mesh points. Since the real-world objects that we 
model are continuous, and the discretization of our meshes is rather
arbitrary, this is not ideal. In Scalismo we usually prefer to work with 
continuous domains. 
Whenever we have an object in Scalismo, which is defined on a discrete domain, 
we can obtain a continuous representation, by means
of interpolation. 

To turn our deformation field into a continuous deformation field, we need to define an ```Interpolator``` and call the ```interpolate```
method:
```scala mdoc:silent
val interpolator = NearestNeighborInterpolator[_3D, EuclideanVector[_3D]]()
val continuousDeformationField : Field[_3D, EuclideanVector[_3D]] = deformationField.interpolate(interpolator)
```

As we do not know much about the structure of the points that define the mesh, 
we use a ```NearestNeighborInterpolator```, which means that for every point on 
which we want to evaluate the deformation, the nearest point on the mesh is 
found and returned. 

The resulting  deformation field is now defined over the entire real space and 
can be evaluated at any 3D Point:

```scala mdoc
continuousDeformationField(Point(-100,-100,-100))
```

*Remark: This approach is general: Any discrete object in Scalismo can be interpolated. 
For more structured domains, such as the ```DiscreteImageDomain```, we can use
more sophisticated interpolation schemes, such as linear or b-spline interpolation.*


### The mean deformation and the mean mesh

Given a set of meshes, we are often interested to compute mesh that represents the mean shape. 
This is equivalent to computing the mean deformation $$\overline{u}$$, and to apply this deformation to them mean mesh. 

To compute the mean deformation, we compute for each point in our mesh the sample mean of the 
deformations at this point in the deformation fields: 

```scala mdoc:silent

val nMeshes = meshes.length

val meanDeformations = reference.pointSet.pointIds.map( id => {

  var meanDeformationForId = EuclideanVector(0, 0, 0)

  val meanDeformations = meshes.foreach (mesh => { // loop through meshes
    val deformationAtId = mesh.pointSet.point(id) - reference.pointSet.point(id)
    meanDeformationForId += deformationAtId * (1.0 / nMeshes)
  })

  meanDeformationForId
})

val meanDeformationField = DiscreteField[_3D, UnstructuredPointsDomain[_3D], EuclideanVector[_3D]](
  reference.pointSet, 
  meanDeformations.toIndexedSeq
)
```

We can now apply the deformation to every point of the reference mesh, to obtain the mean mesh. 
To do this, the easiest way is to first genenerate a transformation from the deformation field, which 
we can use to map every point of the reference to its mean:
```scala mdoc:silent
val continuousMeanDeformationField = meanDeformationField.interpolate(interpolator)

val meanTransformation = Transformation((pt : Point[_3D]) => pt + continuousMeanDeformationField(pt))    
```

To obtain the mean mesh, we simply apply this transformation to the reference mesh:
```scala mdoc:silent
val meanMesh = reference.transform(meanTransformation)
```

Finally, we display the result:
```scala mdoc:silent
ui.show(dsGroup, meanMesh, "mean mesh")
```


```scala mdoc:invisible
ui.close()
```
